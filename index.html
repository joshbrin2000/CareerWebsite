            <h2>Projects/Current Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Creating various webpage templates to get fully comfortable with HTML and CSS. Using the Odin Project as a guideline</p>
                <p>Working with JavaScript to brush up on my skills; after which I will try out Node.js</p>
                <p>I've worked with Python on various projects both personal and in university, yet I've always felt I never used the language to
                    its fullest potential.<br>I am currently reading through Jason C. McDonald's Dead Simple Python to get into the finer details of
                    Python such as mixins, ABCs (Abstract Base Classes)<br> and virtual subclasses, LBYL vs EAFP, etc. Mainly, I'm trying to brainstorm a
                    good project idea that could test my knowledge on the things I have learned thus far</p>
                <p>Getting into the practice of using Git with the terminal rather than depending on the GitHub GUI</p>
                <p>I'm currently using a VM to run Debian; getting fully comfortable with using a Linux distro, mainly with command lines</p>
                <p>I have Godot Engine installed and I have been meaning to try it, but I have been pre-occupied with job hunting and working on other projects to actually <br>
                    have time to do so. I enjoyed my time using Unreal Engine 4, and the fact that Godot is open source is beyond cool</p>
